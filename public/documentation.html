            single movie by title to the user</li>
        <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)</li>
        <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
        <li>Allow new users to register</li>
        <li>Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)</li>
        <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</li>
        <li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites</li>
